{"name":"Pdxdiy","tagline":"Portland Makers Club","body":"### Welcome to Portland Makers Club.\r\nBuilt on a foundation that includes [diy.org](https://diy.org/), Portland Makers Club is a way for young makers to get together and make stuff together.\r\n\r\nThe club is still in the brainstorming and definition phase.\r\n\r\nHere are some thoughts around the Maker Club:\r\n\r\n* Have a monthly badge that everyone gets together and works on.\r\n* Collaborate.\r\n* Have fun.\r\n* Be awesome.\r\n\r\nBelow is the first draft of enough monthly badges and projects to complete the badges:\r\n\r\n* Woodworker\r\n* Mechanical Engineer\r\n* Transport Engineer\r\n* Magician\r\n* Illustrator\r\n* Animator\r\n* Camper\r\n* Rocketeer\r\n* Wind Engineer\r\n* Solar Engineer\r\n* Rapid Prototyper\r\n* Chef\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes from the template that I don't want to delete yet...so disregard.\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
